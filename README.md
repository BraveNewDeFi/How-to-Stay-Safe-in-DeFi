# DeFi Security

While everyone talks about the importance of protecting your assets and staying safe in DeFi, most resources are topic specific, scattered across a multitude of websites. This guide serves as an all-in-one resource that provides basic and intermediary knowledge about operational security practices, as well as an overview of smart contract security. 

This guide is a living resource and will evolve over time.
