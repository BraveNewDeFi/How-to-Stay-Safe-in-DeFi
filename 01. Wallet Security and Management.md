# Wallet Security and Management

Participants in DeFi typically self-custody their assets. Managing your own assets in a crypto wallet gives you full control over your funds but managing your own funds comes with a certain degree of risk. If you're well informed, these risks are minor; the best way to prepare yourself is through education. This page should help you understand general wallet security best practices, how to manage your funds, the difference between the different types of wallets, and how to learn more about wallet security on your own.

Whether you are just starting our in crypto or DeFi, this guide should provide some insight on how to keep your assets safe while you explore this brave new decentralised world.

## Introduction to Cryptocurrency Wallets

Choosing your crypto wallet is not a decision you should take lightly. There are benefits and tradeoffs for each choice, but I'll provide an analogy for each different category to make the topic more accessible. For each different type of wallet, I will include a separate section below. Before I do that, though, I'll provide an overview of the basic functions any crypto wallet provides.

**How a Crypto Wallet Works**

A wallet allows a user to interact with the blockchain directly. While one wallet can contain many different addressess, each address can be broken down into two parts: 
1) The Public Key, which generates an address that other users can send assets to. Assets are held, or custodied, in this address and can only be accessed if someone has the corresponding private key.
2) The Private Key, which is a unique cryptographic code made up of letters and numbers that allows a user to access the funds held in their public address. Because the private key can access funds held in a public address, a private key also allows a user to authorise transactions (e.g., approve interactions with contracts, buy and sell assets, claim yield farming rewards, etc.).

Your private key is incredibly valuable and, if it falls into the wrong hands, you can lose all of your funds in the corresponding public address. With your private key, you can recover assets from any other device. If a hacker or scammer has your private key, they can access your wallet from anywhere. This is important to remember, as you should  never ever, for any reason, share your private key with anyone on the internet. You should keep your private key in a secure location offline. More on that in later sections.

Most wallets generate a Seed Phrase, which can be a unique 12-word or 24-word phrase that can provide a user access to their wallet should they lose access to their wallet. You may lose access to your wallet for a variety of reasons, but you can always use your seed phrase to restore your wallet and all of the corresponding public and private keys within your wallet. You should protect your seed phrase with the same care and caution as your private keys, as your seed phrase is like a master private key that can provide a hacker or scammer access to all of the private keys within your wallet. This is important to remember, as you should  never ever, for any reason, share your seed phrase with anyone on the internet. You should keep your seed phrase in a secure location offline. More on that in later sections.

Here's a helpful way to think of your seed phrase and private keys. Generally, you are assigned an identity at birth or sometime in your youth in most countries around the world. In the United States and the European Union, this is your Social Security Number. If someone is able to access your Social Security Number, they can open accounts, take out loans, and ruin your credit, while putting you into debt. This is referred to as identify theft. 

While most users in DeFi are anonymous, their seed phrase and private keys function as a digital identity, which provides a history of on-chain behaviour as well as access to a user's digital assets. If you use only one wallet, you are putting yourself at greater risk. If one hacker or scammer is able to access your seed phrase or private keys, they can take all of your funds. In all cases, this is a devistating event. 

The best way you can protect yourself in cyrpto is to use different wallets for different use cases, so you limit your risk of loss for any one wallet. In this sense, you're able to fractionalise your digital identity across wallets. If someone can access one wallet, the loss is limited to just that one wallet. The same cannot be said of your government identification number. 

## Software Wallets

Software wallets are easy to use and convenient, and they allow a user to have complete ownership of their private key.

Software wallets are downloaded onto your comoputer, web browser, or on your phone. Because these wallets are alwaays connected to the internet, they are referred to as "hot wallets." With software wallets, users have complete ownership of their private key; however, software wallets are more susceptible to hacks, viruses, and malware because they are always online. If a user's computer and/or phone is compromised, their hot wallet could fall into the wrong hands and their funds could be completely drained from their wallet. 

There are many great software wallets, and not all are created equal. Web wallets are the least secure, as your private key is stored on your personal browser.

Mobile wallets, while convenient for the user on the go, can be compromised if someone else can access a user's phone while the wallet is open. 

Desktop wallets are the most secure, but they, too, are always online, so they are not as secure as a hardware wallet. In the next section, I will review how a hot wallet works along with the benefits and drawbacks of using a hardware wallet.

## Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is both a hot and cold wallet. It's a hot wallet when it's connected to a computer and, thus, the internet, but if the wallet is disconnected from a computer, it is taken offline and protected against any attempts to access your private keys or seed phrase. The ability to hold your private keys and seed phrase offline is what makes a hardware wallet a cold wallet. 

A hardware wallet stores the private keys directly on the wallet, and it needs to be plugged into a computer or connected via bluetooth to interact with the blockchain. Hardware wallets generally have a PIN or some other access code that makes it more difficult for someone to physically access your hardware wallet. 

If a user's computer is ever compromised due to phishing, viruses, malware, etc., then a hacker won't be able to access a harware wallet because the private keys/seed phrase is held within the wallet and cannot be accessed through the computer. 

While hardware wallets are the safest way to manage digital assets, there are extra steps that need to be taken in order to execute on-chain transactions. Depending on the model, hardware wallets can be portable but not all can work with a phone. Some hardware wallets are small enough to fit in your hand (e.g., Ledger and Trezor) but the screen on these hardware wallets is small and difficult to read, which means it is difficult to confirm the exact transaction you are approving on the wallet itself. 

The main tradeoff with hardware wallets: they provide the most secure way to store your private keys but not all can be used on the go; extra steps are usually involved to execute transactions. This is the tradeoff necessary for optimal security.

**If you're storing a considerable amount of assets, you should use a hardware wallet.**

## Multisig Wallets

Multi-sig is short for multi-signature, and multi-sig wallets require two or more signatures to execute a transaction. Many Decentralised Autonomous Organiisations (DAOs) use multi-sig wallets to control community funds or treasury funds. Individuals can use multi-sig wallets to hold assets shared by a group of people, or an individual can use a multi-sig wallet to custody funds they want extra layers of security for. 

Many multi-sig wallets require three-of-five signatures to conduct a transaction. If one user or even two have their computers compromised, hackers would be one key short of being able to access any funds within the wallet. 

Multi-sig wallets are used by DAOs, groups of individuals, people conducting transactions with a neutral third party intermediary, etc. A multi-sig wallet is typically used by an organisation rather than an individual.

## Managing Your Wallet(s)

As discussed above, a user can limit their risk by using different wallets for different use cases. To give you an exmaple, I'll talk about a hypothetical NFT artist named Vincent.

**Vincent the NFT Artist**

Vincent is like any other digital post-impressionist working in DeFi. He tries to stay safe and uses different wallets for different activities. One for minting and selling his NFTs; one for his personal NFT collection; one for the digital assets he puts to work in DeFi; one wallet for long-term holding; and one wallet for light spending in DeFi. 

Vincent uses a mix of hot wallets (always connected to the internet with public and private key accessible on a computer) and cold wallets (can be kept offline with the public key accessible on the internet but the private key is NOT accessible and is stored offline). 

One day, Vincent gets a DM on Twitter and someone asks him to do a commissioned piece. They include a link in the message and Vincent clicks on it, only to download malware that compromises his computer. The hacker is able to steal funds from one of his five wallets. The wallet for light spending is drained of all its funds, but Vincent is able to transfer the NFTs he has listed to one of his cold wallets where his personal NFT collection is, so instead of losing his whole head, he only loses the equivalent of one ear.

As demonstrated by Vincent, using different wallets for different use cases is a great way to protect yourself in the event your computer is compromised. If you only use one wallet for minting NFTs, selling your NFTs, receiving royalties, buying and selling assets, etc., you put yourself at greater risk of losing funds should your computer and/or wallet is compromised.

## Backing Up Your Wallet(s)

It doesn't matter what kind of wallet you have, it's always important to securely backup your seed phrase and private keys for your wallet(s). Each different wallet can require a different method, so I will break each one out below (besides multi-sig wallets).

**Backing Up Your Hardware Wallet(s)**

To back up your hardware wallet, you just need to write down the 24-word phrase (i.e., seed phrase) on the card that comes with your hardware wallet or on a piece of paper. Store this phrase somewhere secure and do not ever keep this phrase on a digital device (e.g., in the Notes app on your phone). **Remember that the seed phrase can give someone else access to all of the funds in your wallet.** 

You can always store a master copy of your seed phrase in a secure location and split another copy into three part, which you can secure separately in secure locations (e.g., safety deposit boxes in a bank). **Treat your seed phrase and/or private key(s) like your Social Security Number. Do not give it to anyone online.**

**Backing Up Your Software Wallet(s)**

When you create your wallet (and at any time while the wallet is in your control), you can access your seed phrase or private key(s). You will have to enter the password you created for your wallet to access this information. 

You can print off this information to create a Paper Wallet (a paper copy of your private key). If you do this, connect directly to your printer and **do not use a WiFi connection to your printer.** You can also write your seed phrase down on a piece of paper and store your seed phrase securely. **Treat your seed phrase and/or private key(s) like your Social Security Number. Do not give it to anyone online.**

**Crypto Steel**

For seed phrase and/or private key management, you can buy a crypto steel wallet, which is literally a piece of steel you can stamp your seed phrase into manually. Using a crypto steel cold wallet will protect your seed phrase in the event there is a fire. Paper wallets can be compromised by water, fire, etc., and crypto steel cold wallets are a more durable way to store your seed phrase.

## Concluding Remarks

When you're storing your digital assets in a crypto wallet, treat your digital assets as you would your cash assets in real life.

* **Hardware Wallet:** Think of this as your bank. You want the best possible security for the majority of your funds, and while it requires a few more steps to execute transactions while using a hardware wallet, you still have access to your funds 24/7. Hardware wallets can be portable, but they are not as convenient as software wallets when you're on the go. Always remember the sacrifice you make with a hardware wallet is for the best possible security for a majority of your assets. You keep your seed phrase and private key offline for the same reason you keep your Social Security Number secure and out of reach from malicious scammers and hackers. 
* **Software Wallet:** Think of a software wallet as your wallet or purse in real life. You keep some of your digital assets in a software wallet, such as a desktop or mobile wallet, but you don't want to keep ALL of your assets in a software wallet because it's always connected to the internet. If someone can access your software wallet by compromising your computer, they may be able to completely drain your wallet of all it's funds much like a pickpocket can slice the purse right off your shoulder or take the wallet right out of your back pocket.

Being your own bank and managing your own seed phrase and private keys can seem daunting but with a little caution up front along with best practices in your day-to-day online activities will keep your assets safe and your mind free from worry.
