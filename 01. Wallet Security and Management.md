# Wallet Security and Management

Participants in DeFi typically self-custody their assets. Managing your own assets in a crypto wallet gives you full control over your funds but managing your own funds comes with a certain degree of risk. If you're well informed, these risks are minor; the best way to prepare yourself is through education. This page should help you understand general wallet security best practices, how to manage your funds, the difference between the different types of wallets, and how to learn more about wallet security on your own.

Whether you are just starting our in crypto or DeFi, this guide should provide some insight on how to keep your assets safe while you explore this brave new decentralised world.

## Introduction to Cryptocurrency Wallets

Choosing your crypto wallet is not a decision you should take lightly. There are benefits and tradeoffs for each choice, but I'll provide an analogy for each different category to make the topic more accessible. For each different type of wallet, I will include a separate section below. Before I do that, though, I'll provide an overview of the basic functions any crypto wallet provides.

**How a Crypto Wallet Works**

A wallet allows a user to interact with the blockchain directly. While one wallet can contain many different addressess, each address can be broken down into two parts: 
1) The Public Key, which generates an address that other users can send assets to. Assets are held, or custodied, in this address and can only be accessed if someone has the corresponding private key.
2) The Private Key, which is a unique cryptographic code made up of letters and numbers that allows a user to access the funds held in their public address. Because the private key can access funds held in a public address, a private key also allows a user to authorise transactions (e.g., approve interactions with contracts, buy and sell assets, claim yield farming rewards, etc.).

Your private key is incredibly valuable and, if it falls into the wrong hands, you can lose all of your funds in the corresponding public address. With your private key, you can recover assets from any other device. If a hacker or scammer has your private key, they can access your wallet from anywhere. This is important to remember, as you should  never ever, for any reason, share your private key with anyone on the internet. You should keep your private key in a secure location offline. More on that in later sections.

Most wallets generate a Seed Phrase, which can be a unique 12-word or 24-word phrase that can provide a user access to their wallet should they lose access to their wallet. You may lose access to your wallet for a variety of reasons, but you can always use your seed phrase to restore your wallet and all of the corresponding public and private keys within your wallet. You should protect your seed phrase with the same care and caution as your private keys, as your seed phrase is like a master private key that can provide a hacker or scammer access to all of the private keys within your wallet. This is important to remember, as you should  never ever, for any reason, share your seed phrase with anyone on the internet. You should keep your seed phrase in a secure location offline. More on that in later sections.

Here's a helpful way to think of your seed phrase and private keys. Generally, you are assigned an identity at birth or sometime in your youth in most countries around the world. In the United States and the European Union, this is your Social Security Number. If someone is able to access your Social Security Number, they can open accounts, take out loans, and ruin your credit, while putting you into debt. This is referred to as identify theft. 

While most users in DeFi are anonymous, their seed phrase and private keys function as a digital identity, which provides a history of on-chain behaviour as well as access to a user's digital assets. If you use only one wallet, you are putting yourself at greater risk. If one hacker or scammer is able to access your seed phrase or private keys, they can take all of your funds. In all cases, this is a devistating event. 

The best way you can protect yourself in cyrpto is to use different wallets for different use cases, so you limit your risk of loss for any one wallet. In this sense, you're able to fractionalise your digital identity across wallets. If someone can access one wallet, the loss is limited to just that one wallet. The same cannot be said of your government identification number.

## Managing Your Wallet(s)

As discussed above, a user can limit their risk by using different wallets for different use cases. To give you an exmaple, I'll talk about a hypothetical NFT artist named Vincent.

**Vincent the NFT Artist**

Vincent is like any other digital post-impressionist working in DeFi. He tries to stay safe and uses different wallets for different activities. One for minting and selling his NFTs; one for his personal NFT collection; one for the digital assets he puts to work in DeFi; one wallet for long-term holding; and one wallet for light spending in DeFi. 

Vincent uses a mix of hot wallets (always connected to the internet with public and private key accessible on a computer) and cold wallets (can be kept offline with the public key accessible on the internet but the private key is NOT accessible and is stored offline). 

One day, Vincent gets a DM on Twitter and someone asks him to do a commissioned piece. They include a link in the message and Vincent clicks on it, only to download malware that compromises his computer. The hacker is able to steal funds from one of his five wallets. The wallet for light spending is drained of all its funds, but Vincent is able to transfer the NFTs he has listed to one of his cold wallets where his personal NFT collection is, so instead of losing his whole head, he only loses the equivalent of one ear.

As demonstrated by Vincent, using different wallets for different use cases is a great way to protect yourself in the event your computer is compromised. If you only use one wallet for minting NFTs, selling your NFTs, receiving royalties, buying and selling assets, etc., you put yourself at greater risk of losing funds should your computer and/or wallet is compromised.
